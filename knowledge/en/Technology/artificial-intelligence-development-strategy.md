# Taiwan's Artificial Intelligence Development and Future Strategy

> **30-second overview:** In 2025, TSMC captured 72% of global foundry revenue, holding a near-monopoly on the manufacture of all advanced AI chips. Foxconn, Quanta, and Wistron — three Taiwanese companies — together produce about 90% of the world's AI servers, each reporting annual revenue exceeding NT$1 trillion. But this hardware empire has an anxiety: as the center of value in AI shifts from chips toward models and data, is being a contract manufacturer still enough? From the AI lab founded by PTT creator Tu Yi-chin, to the government-backed Traditional Chinese large language model TAIDE, a transformation — from "making AI" to "becoming AI" — is underway.

## The Trillion-Dollar Night Market Dinner

In June 2024, on the eve of Computex, an unusual group of diners appeared at Ningxia Night Market in Taipei. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang arrived with TSMC founder Morris Chang, Quanta chairman Barry Lam, and MediaTek CEO Rick Tsai, squeezing together in front of a street stall to eat oyster omelets. Passersby recognized Huang, and within moments fans and reporters surrounded the scene — more like a celebrity sighting than a tech gathering.[^1]

The combined market cap of the companies these men represent exceeds several trillion dollars. But the real story wasn't at the dinner table — it was in the supply chain behind it. These individuals represent companies that undergird the physical infrastructure of global AI computation. During that Taiwan visit, Huang said publicly: "Taiwan is one of the most important countries in the world."[^2] That was no diplomatic pleasantry. Without Taiwan, the hardware foundation of the AI revolution would not exist.

Jensen Huang was born in Taipei in 1963, grew up in Tainan, and emigrated to the United States at age nine.[^3] NVIDIA, which he co-founded in 1993, is now synonymous with AI chips. Every advanced GPU NVIDIA designs — from the A100 and H100 used to train ChatGPT, to the latest Blackwell series — is manufactured entirely by TSMC.[^4]

## Hardware: One Island Sustaining the Entire AI Revolution

Taiwan's position in the AI hardware supply chain defies description with the word "important" alone.

**Chip manufacturing:** In 2025, TSMC captured 72% of global foundry revenue.[^5] In the most advanced sub-7nm process nodes, TSMC's market share exceeds 90%. NVIDIA holds roughly 86% of the AI GPU market, and virtually all of those GPUs are made by TSMC.[^6] In other words, the vast majority of the computing power used worldwide to train and run AI models originates in Taiwan's cleanrooms.

**Server assembly:** After chips are made, they must be assembled into servers before entering data centers. Here too, Taiwan dominates. The three major ODMs — Foxconn, Quanta, and Wistron — together produce about 90% of the world's AI servers.[^7] In 2025, each of these three companies reported annual revenues exceeding NT$1 trillion (approximately US$32 billion), with AI server revenue surpassing consumer electronics revenue for the first time in the second quarter.[^8]

**Advanced packaging:** AI chip performance depends not just on process shrinkage, but on packaging technology. TSMC's CoWoS (Chip on Wafer on Substrate) advanced packaging is critical to achieving NVIDIA's high-end GPU performance targets. In 2026, NVIDIA alone is projected to consume 595,000 CoWoS wafers — 60% of total global demand.[^9]

Foxconn is also partnering with NVIDIA and the Taiwan government to build a 100-megawatt AI factory supercomputer in Kaohsiung, using the latest NVIDIA Blackwell architecture.[^10] Taiwan is upgrading from "the place that makes AI chips" to "the place that runs AI."

## From PTT to an AI Lab: Tu Yi-chin's Two Startups

In 1995, Tu Yi-chin — a sophomore in National Taiwan University's Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering — built [PTT](/en/Technology/ptt-bulletin-board-system/) from a single 486 computer and open-source software in his dormitory room. Thirty years later, PTT still attracts hundreds of thousands of daily visitors; it is a living fossil of Taiwan's internet culture.

Tu later joined Microsoft, contributing to the development of the Cortana voice assistant. In 2017, he turned down a high salary in Silicon Valley and returned to Taiwan to found Taiwan AI Labs — Asia's first nonprofit, open AI research institution.[^11]

His motivation was direct: Taiwan has world-class software talent, but that talent keeps leaving for Silicon Valley. He wanted to build a platform where people who wanted to return or stay could do AI research.

Taiwan AI Labs' best-known product is "Yating" — a speech recognition system optimized for Traditional Chinese and Taiwanese accents. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the lab also developed misinformation detection tools and federated learning medical AI.[^12] These projects share a common thread: they solve Taiwan-specific problems using Taiwan-specific data, rather than translating American models into Chinese.

Tu's story — from PTT to AI Labs — is in some ways a microcosm of Taiwan's software development trajectory: not lacking technical ability, but lacking the ecosystem to retain talent.

## TAIDE: Why Taiwan Needs Its Own Language Model

In April 2023, six months after ChatGPT swept the world, Taiwan's National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) launched the TAIDE project — Trustworthy AI Dialogue Engine.[^13]

Why would an island of 23 million people build its own large language model?

The reasons go beyond technological self-reliance. Traditional Chinese is dramatically underrepresented in global AI training data; most Chinese-language data comes from simplified Chinese websites. When Taiwanese users interact with ChatGPT or other models, the responses often carry Mainland Chinese vocabulary habits and implicit assumptions. "視頻" instead of "影片" for "video," "質量" instead of "品質" for "quality" — these seemingly minor differences are, at their core, a question of cultural autonomy. CommonWealth Magazine ran a headline framing TAIDE as "preventing Chinese AI cultural invasion."[^14]

In April 2024, the TAIDE team released the commercial TAIDE-LX-7B and the academic TAIDE-LX-13B models, which performed well on tasks such as writing, translation, and summarization.[^15] By 2026, TAIDE 2.0 was released, and together with MediaTek's supported Breeze-8B model, Taiwan's LLM ecosystem moved from a "catching up" phase into a "usable" phase.[^16]

More interesting is the flowering of applications. National Chung Hsing University used TAIDE to build an agricultural knowledge retrieval system called "Shennong TAIDE"; National University of Tainan developed a Taiwanese-English dialogue bot for Taiwanese language teaching; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University trained TAIDE models in Taiwanese and Hakka.[^17] These applications confirm one thing: language models are not merely technology products; they are cultural carriers. An AI that does not understand "Tian Chuan Day" (天穿日) or Mazu pilgrimage processions cannot truly serve Taiwanese people.

## Cybersecurity AI Forged by Attacks

Taiwan is one of the most frequently cyberattacked countries in the world. This unfortunate reality has, unexpectedly, given birth to a formidable AI cybersecurity industry.

CyCraft, founded in late 2017, was Taiwan's first cybersecurity company to combine AI with endpoint monitoring. Its technology has been cited seven times by global research firm Gartner, and it is the only Taiwanese vendor to have passed the authoritative US MITRE ATT&CK evaluation three times.[^18] In February 2026, CyCraft listed on the TPEx Innovation Board, becoming Taiwan's first AI cybersecurity software company with internationally capable, proprietary R&D.[^19]

CyCraft's clients include Taiwan government agencies, defense units, banks, and semiconductor companies — precisely the targets most frequently locked in by nation-state hackers. The company has subsidiaries in Japan and Singapore and is exporting "combat experience forged under attack" across the Asia-Pacific region.

This case illustrates one thing: Taiwan's AI advantage comes not only from semiconductors, but from real-world battle-tested capabilities honed under a unique geopolitical situation.

## Policy: From "AI Inaugural Year" to the Ministry of Digital Affairs

Taiwan's AI policy development can be understood through three milestones.

**2017–2018: Beginnings.** The Executive Yuan designated 2017 as the "AI Inaugural Year" and introduced the concept of "Big Strategy for a Small AI Nation," acknowledging Taiwan's small market but emphasizing its three cards: semiconductor manufacturing, ICT supply chains, and engineering talent. In 2018, the first phase of the "Taiwan AI Action Plan" was launched, investing over NT$40 billion over four years, with a key focus on building the AI computing infrastructure "Taiwan AI Cloud" (TWCC).[^20]

**2022: Institutionalization.** The Ministry of Digital Affairs (moda) was established, integrating digital functions previously scattered across the Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Ministry of Transportation. The significance: AI policy was elevated from "a MOST project" to "a cross-ministerial national strategy." That same year, the government issued the "Guidelines for the Development of AI Research," emphasizing human-centered, transparent, explainable, and non-discriminatory principles.

**2023 to present: The generative AI pivot.** The shock of ChatGPT forced a sharp policy turn. The TAIDE initiative was launched, a draft AI Basic Act was advanced, and AI adoption in the public sector accelerated. Taiwan's strategy is pragmatic: rather than competing with the US or China on fundamental research paper counts, it grafts AI onto its existing manufacturing advantages — smart manufacturing, medical imaging, semiconductor yield prediction. These are domains where Taiwan has unique data, use cases, and competitive advantages that others cannot easily replicate.

## Anxiety: The Software Gap in a Hardware Empire

Behind the glossy numbers, Taiwan's AI development has a structural problem: a severe imbalance between hardware and software.

Taiwan produces 90% of the world's AI servers and a large share of AI chips, but has minimal presence in the "soft" layers of AI model development, data ecosystems, and platform software. Not one of the world's top twenty AI models — GPT, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA — comes from Taiwan.

The cause is an updated version of an old problem. When TSMC engineers can earn over NT$2 million annually, software startups struggle to attract top talent. Google, Microsoft, and NVIDIA have established R&D centers in Taiwan, creating powerful gravitational pulls with salaries and benefits. A National Taiwan University Computer Science graduate's first choice is typically a foreign firm or TSMC's IT department — not joining a domestic AI startup.

The more fundamental challenge is data. An AI model's value derives from its training data, and the volume of high-quality Traditional Chinese data is minuscule compared to English or Simplified Chinese. Taiwan's population of 23 million naturally produces far less text than the English-speaking world or Mainland China. TAIDE attempts to address this problem, but the structural data disadvantage remains.

Taiwan's real AI bet is not to compete head-on with OpenAI or Google in foundation models, but to find irreplaceable positions in vertical applications — semiconductor process AI, medical imaging AI, cybersecurity AI, Traditional Chinese NLP. These are domains where Taiwan has unique data and use-case advantages that others cannot easily copy.

## An Island's AI Choices

In 2026, Taiwan occupies a unique position: it has never been more indispensable in the AI hardware supply chain, yet it remains marginal in the AI software ecosystem.

This is not entirely bad. Historically, Taiwan's success model has always been "don't be the brand — be the brand behind the brand." The pure-foundry model Morris Chang invented in 1987 made TSMC one of the world's top-ten companies by market cap. Today, the same logic is repeating in the AI server industry — Foxconn doesn't make AI models, but the world's AI models all run on servers Foxconn assembles.

But the rules of the AI era may be different. As value shifts from hardware toward software and data, the profit margins of pure contract manufacturing will be compressed. Taiwan needs to grow software and data capabilities atop its hardware dominance — not to replace hardware, but to add new value layers above it.

TAIDE is one attempt. CyCraft is one attempt. Taiwan AI Labs is one attempt. What they have in common: none aims to build "the world's biggest AI," but rather "the AI that understands Taiwan best."

This may be the AI wisdom of a small nation: don't fight giants head-on in every arena, but build advantages on your own terrain, with your own data and use cases, that others cannot replicate.
